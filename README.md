## ðŸ§  How It Works (The Math)  
 **Step 1:** You enter the paycheck and debts of both people  . 
 **Step 2:** The app calculates each personâ€™s **net income**  
 **Step 3:** It adds both net incomes to get a total  
 **Step 4:** It calculates each personâ€™s **percentage** of that total  
 **Step 5:** Those percentages are applied to the total expenses  
 **Step 6:** You see exactly how much each person owes  

No more 50/50 splits that arenâ€™t actually fair!
